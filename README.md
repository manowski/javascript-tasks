# SwingDev MaStaż - Tasks

Hello! 👋 We are thrilled to have you here!

We hope you will enjoy the journey of implementation of these tasks, and they will give
you a chance to learn something interesting new!

*Our internship task consists of two smaller tasks that will test you from different angles.*
- The first assignment is a chance to show us your CSS/JS skills by adding new features to an already existing app.
- The second task is a different story. We'd like to see your logic skills in action, find solutions for two logic problems
that will work for all the edge cases and test your solutions by yourself by adding tests.

**All the information you'll need will be inside tasks folders, but a few additional tips won't hurt anyone:**
- Take all the time you need to do your best - solving the tasks faster won’t increase your chances 🙂
Just ensure to meet the deadline and send us your solution by the end of May (31.05).
- When it comes to rules, there’s only one that you probably know from school anyway - don’t
share the task with anyone and work on it on your own. We’ll check when the time comes 😉
- If you have any questions regarding the task, please write to Stosiu
(hopefully your soon-to-be mentor) directly at aleksander.stos@swing.dev.
- We'll contact you in June to let you know if you got into the next stage - a short interview with selected candidates. 

## How to start working on it?
There are two folders `1-front-end-app` and `2-logic-tests` with `README.md` files inside. Take a look at them
to learn what you should do.

## How to submit your solutions?
Please send us a link to the task as a reply to the email you received from us. If you have trouble finding it in your inbox,
look for aleksander.stos@swing.dev. Bundle everything to `.zip` file and use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
to upload and share the file with us. We won't open files uploaded using other services for security reasons.
Thanks for understanding!

## Some key facts about the internship itself:
- The internship can only take place in our office in Warsaw. There is no remote option.
If you can join us there, we are waiting to have you on board! 
- You've probably heard about this pandemic everyone’s talking about, but if it all goes well,
and we’ll be able to provide you a truly safe environment, the internship will start on July 6.
- All of the crucial information can be found at [SwingDev MaStaż website](https://www.swing.dev/mastaz).
It’s also a good place to revisit if you temporarily struggle with motivation. MaStaż will really
be an awesome 6 weeks! 👏

Thanks again and good luck!
