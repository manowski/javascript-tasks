# Javascript Tasks

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ We are thrilled to have you here!

We hope you will enjoy the journey of implementation of these tasks, and they will give
you a chance to learn something interesting new!

*Our task consists of two smaller tasks that will test you from different angles.*
- The first assignment is a chance to show us your CSS/JS skills by adding new features to an already existing app.
- The second task is a different story. We'd like to see your logic skills in action, find solutions for two logic problems
that will work for all the edge cases and test your solutions by yourself by adding tests.

## How to start working on it?
There are two folders `1-front-end-app` and `2-logic-tests` with `README.md` files inside. Take a look at them
to learn what you should do.
