# Logic tasks


## Getting Started
It's easy, start with installing all the dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

You're ready to go!
Go to `src/task1`, and `src/task2`, carefully read thought the task description, add your implementation and tests to cover
all use cases. Remember about edge situations and make sure you return a correct output in more extended situations.

## Available Scripts
+ `test` - run all tests,
+ `test1` - run tests for task 1,
+ `test2` - run tests for task 2,
+ `test:watch` - interactive watch mode to automatically re-run all tests
+ `test1:watch` - interactive watch mode to automatically re-run tests for task 1,
+ `test2:watch` - interactive watch mode to automatically re-run tests for task 2

Interactive means that each time you change something, the test will re-run.
