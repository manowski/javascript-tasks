# SwingDev MaSta≈º - Logic tasks

Congrats on finishing the first part! This time we will test your logical thinking and 
general Javascript knowledge. You will find two tasks `Balance by the category` and `Duplicated transactions` in this
assignment. Please read `README.md` file in each task for further details about that needs to be implemented.

**What we expect?**
1) Make sure to try your best to present us a well written, well tested, and NOT over-engineered code.
2) We're looking for a well-structured, tested, simple solution for each of two tasks.

**How will we check your solutions?**
1. We will run our set of tests against your solutions
2. We will evaluate your test cases and code implementation

**How can I earn additional points?**
1. Use [TypeScript][typescript], just change `.js`s to `.ts`s, and add start typing
2. Use [ES6][es6] features

This project uses:
+ [Jest][jest] for fast unit testing
+ [Prettier][prettier] to enforce consistent code style

## Getting Started
It's easy, start with installing all the dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

You're ready to go!
Go to `src/task1`, and `src/task2`, carefully read thought the task description, add your implementation and tests to cover
all use cases. Remember about edge situations and make sure you return a correct output in more extended situations.

## Available Scripts
+ `test` - run all tests,
+ `test1` - run tests for task 1,
+ `test2` - run tests for task 2,
+ `test:watch` - interactive watch mode to automatically re-run all tests
+ `test1:watch` - interactive watch mode to automatically re-run tests for task 1,
+ `test2:watch` - interactive watch mode to automatically re-run tests for task 2

Interactive means that each time you change something, the test will re-run.
